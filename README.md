### Hi there 👋

<!--
**hypercalm/hypercalm** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making machines smarter
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DeepLearning frameworks
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating sentience. :D
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning in general and Neural Networks in particular!
- 📫 How to reach me: If we go back to the beginning of time, you and I would be in a point. :P
- ⚡ Fun fact: What if sentience is just an illusion that makes us feel special?
