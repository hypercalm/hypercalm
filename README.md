### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**hypercalm/hypercalm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making machines smarter.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DeepLearning frameworks.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating sentience. :D
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning in general and Neural Networks in particular!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: If we go back to the beginning of time, you and I would be in a point. :P
- âš¡ Fun fact: What if sentience is just an illusion that makes us feel special?
